# Snowflake Dev Day 2025: Gen AI Bootcamp 

## Build Data Agents using Snowflake Cortex AI

In this step-by-step lab, you’ll learn how to build a Data Agent using Snowflake Cortex AI that can intelligently respond to sales assistant questions by reasoning over both structured and unstructured data.

We’ll begin by setting up the tools that power the agent’s capabilities. Snowflake provides two powerful components to achieve this:

* Cortex Analyst – for analyzing structured data 
* Cortex Search – for performing semantic search across unstructured content

To make this lab hands-on and grounded, we’ll use a custom dataset focused on bikes and skis. This dataset is intentionally artificial and not available on the public web, ensuring that no external LLM has prior knowledge of it — giving you a clean, controlled environment to test and evaluate your agent.

The first step is to either:

* Create your own Snowflake Trial Account, or
* Use the account provided for you during the hands-on session.

Next, you’ll use Snowflake Git integration to pull down the necessary files, schema, and content that power this lab.

By the end of the session, you’ll have a working AI-powered agent capable of understanding and retrieving insights across diverse data types — all securely within Snowflake.

## Step 1: Setup GIT Integration 

Open a Worksheet, copy/paste the following code and execute all. This will set up the GIT repository and will copy everything you will be using during the lab.

``` sql
CREATE or replace DATABASE DASH_CORTEX_AGENTS_SUMMIT;

CREATE OR REPLACE API INTEGRATION git_api_integration
  API_PROVIDER = git_https_api
  API_ALLOWED_PREFIXES = ('https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/')
  ENABLED = TRUE;

CREATE OR REPLACE GIT REPOSITORY git_repo
    api_integration = git_api_integration
    origin = 'https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-data-agents-using-snowflake-cortex';

-- Make sure we get the latest files
ALTER GIT REPOSITORY git_repo FETCH;

-- Setup stage for  Docs
create or replace stage docs ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE') DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = true );

-- Copy the docs for bikes
COPY FILES
    INTO @docs/
    FROM @DASH_CORTEX_AGENTS_SUMMIT.PUBLIC.git_repo/branches/main/docs/;

ALTER STAGE docs REFRESH;

```

## Step 2: Setup Unstructured Data Tools to be Used by the Agent

We are going to be using a Snowflake Notebook to set up the Tools that will be used by the Snowflake Cortex Agents API. Open the Notebook and follow each of the cells.

Select the Notebook that you have available in your Snowflake account within the Git Repositories:

![image](img/1_create_notebook.png)

Give the notebook a name and run it in a Container using CPUs.

![image](img/2_run_on_wh.png)

you can run the entire Notebook and check each of the cells. This is the explanation for Unstructured Data section.

Thanks to the GIT integration done in the previous step, the PDF and IMAGE files that we are going to be using have already been copied into your Snowflake account. We are using two sets of documents, one for bikes and other for skis and images for both. 

Check the content of the directory with documents (PDF and JPEG). Note that this is an internal staging area but it could also be an external S3 location, so there is no need to actually copy the PDFs into Snowflake. 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM DIRECTORY('@DOCS');
```
### PDF Documents

To parse the documents, we are going to use the native Cortex [PARSE_DOCUMENT](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/parse_document-snowflake-cortex). For LAYOUT we can specify OCR or LAYOUT. We will be using LAYOUT so the content is markdown formatted.

```SQL

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE RAW_TEXT AS
SELECT 
    RELATIVE_PATH,
    TO_VARCHAR (
        SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.PARSE_DOCUMENT (
            '@DOCS',
            RELATIVE_PATH,
            {'mode': 'LAYOUT'} ):content
        ) AS EXTRACTED_LAYOUT 
FROM 
    DIRECTORY('@DOCS')
WHERE
    RELATIVE_PATH LIKE '%.pdf';

SELECT * FROM RAW_TEXT;
```

Next we are going to split the content of the PDF file into chunks with some overlaps to make sure information and context are not lost. You can read more about token limits and text splitting in the [Cortex Search Documentation ](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview)

Create the table that will be used by Cortex Search Service as a Tool for Cortex Agents in order to retrieve information from PDF and JPEG files:

```SQL
create or replace TABLE DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE ( 
    RELATIVE_PATH VARCHAR(16777216), -- Relative path to the PDF file
    CHUNK VARCHAR(16777216), -- Piece of text
    CHUNK_INDEX INTEGER, -- Index for the text
    CATEGORY VARCHAR(16777216) -- Will hold the document category to enable filtering
);
```

To split the text we also use the native Cortex [SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/split_text_recursive_character-snowflake-cortex). 

```SQL
-- Create chunks from extracted content
insert into DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE (relative_path, chunk, chunk_index)

    select relative_path, 
            c.value::TEXT as chunk,
            c.INDEX::INTEGER as chunk_index
            
    from 
        raw_text,
        LATERAL FLATTEN( input => SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SPLIT_TEXT_RECURSIVE_CHARACTER (
              EXTRACTED_LAYOUT,
              'markdown',
              1512,
              256,
              ['\n\n', '\n', ' ', '']
           )) c;

SELECT * FROM DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE;
```

See how CLASSIFY_TEXT Cortex function can be used to classify the document type. We have two classes: Bike and Snow, and we will pass the document title and the first chunk of the document to the function.

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY TABLE docs_categories AS WITH unique_documents AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT relative_path, chunk
  FROM
    docs_chunks_table
  WHERE 
    chunk_index = 0
  ),
 docs_category_cte AS (
  SELECT
    relative_path,
    TRIM(snowflake.cortex.CLASSIFY_TEXT (
      'Title:' || relative_path || 'Content:' || chunk, ['Bike', 'Snow']
     )['label'], '"') AS category
  FROM
    unique_documents
)
SELECT
  *
FROM
  docs_category_cte;
```

You can check the categories:

```SQL
select * from docs_categories;
```
And update the table:

```SQL
update docs_chunks_table 
  SET category = docs_categories.category
  from docs_categories
  where  docs_chunks_table.relative_path = docs_categories.relative_path;
```
### IMAGE Documents

Now let's process the images we have for our bikes and skis. We are going to use the COMPLETE multi-modal function asking for an image description and classification. We will add this information into the DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE where we also have the PDF documentation:

```SQL
insert into DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE (relative_path, chunk, chunk_index, category)
SELECT 
    RELATIVE_PATH,
    CONCAT('This is a picture describing the bike: '|| RELATIVE_PATH || 
        'THIS IS THE DESCRIPTION: ' ||
        SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('claude-3-5-sonnet',
        'DESCRIBE THIS IMAGE: ',
        TO_FILE('@DOCS', RELATIVE_PATH))) as chunk,
    0,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('claude-3-5-sonnet',
        'Classify this image, respond only with Bike or Snow: ',
        TO_FILE('@DOCS', RELATIVE_PATH)) as category,
FROM 
    DIRECTORY('@DOCS')
WHERE
    RELATIVE_PATH LIKE '%.jpeg';
```

Check the descriptions created and that the Tool that will be used to retrieve information when needed:

```SQL
select * from DOCS_CHUNKS_TABLE
    where RELATIVE_PATH LIKE '%.jpeg';
```

### Enable Cortex Search Service

Now that we have processed the PDF and IMAGE documents, we can create a [Cortex Search Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview) that automatically will create embeddings and indexes over the chunks of text extracted. Read the docs for the different embedding models available.

When creating the service, we also specify what is the TARGET_LAG. This is the frequency used by the service to maintain the service with new or deleted data. Check the [Automatic Processing of New Documents](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/ask_questions_to_your_own_documents_with_snowflake_cortex_search/index.html?index=..%2F..index#6) of that quickstart to understand how easy is to maintain your RAG updated when using Cortex Search.

```SQL
create or replace CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE DOCUMENTATION_TOOL
ON chunk
ATTRIBUTES relative_path, category
warehouse = COMPUTE_WH
TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0'
as (
    select chunk,
        chunk_index,
        relative_path,
        category
    from docs_chunks_table
);
```

## Step 3: Set Up Structured Data to be Used by the Agent
Another Tool that we will provide to the Cortex Agent will be Cortex Analyst, which will provide the capability to extract information from Snowflake Tables. In the API call we will provider the location of a Semantic file that contains information about the business terminology used to describe the data.

First we are going to create some synthetic data about the bike and ski products that we have.

We are going to create the following tables with content:

**DIM_ARTICLE – Article/Item Dimension**

Purpose: Stores descriptive information about the products (articles) being sold.

Key Columns:

    ARTICLE_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each article.
    ARTICLE_NAME: Full name/description of the product.
    ARTICLE_CATEGORY: Product category (e.g., Bike, Skis, Ski Boots).
    ARTICLE_BRAND: Manufacturer or brand (e.g., Mondracer, Carver).
    ARTICLE_COLOR: Dominant color for the article.
    ARTICLE_PRICE: Standard unit price of the article.
    DIM_CUSTOMER – Customer Dimension

**DIM_CUSTOMER – Customer Dimension**

Purpose: Contains demographic and segmentation info about each customer.

Key Columns:

    CUSTOMER_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each customer.
    CUSTOMER_NAME: Display name for the customer.
    CUSTOMER_REGION: Geographic region (e.g., North, South).
    CUSTOMER_AGE: Age of the customer.
    CUSTOMER_GENDER: Gender (Male/Female).
    CUSTOMER_SEGMENT: Marketing segment (e.g., Premium, Regular, Occasional).
    FACT_SALES – Sales Transactions Fact Table

**FACT_SALES – Sales Transactions Fact Table**

Purpose: Captures individual sales transactions (facts) with references to article and customer details.

Key Columns:

    SALE_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the transaction.
    ARTICLE_ID (Foreign Key): Links to DIM_ARTICLE.
    CUSTOMER_ID (Foreign Key): Links to DIM_CUSTOMER.
    DATE_SALES: Date when the sale occurred.
    QUANTITY_SOLD: Number of units sold in the transaction.
    TOTAL_PRICE: Total transaction value (unit price × quantity).
    SALES_CHANNEL: Sales channel used (e.g., Online, In-Store, Partner).
    PROMOTION_APPLIED: Boolean indicating if the sale involved a promotion or discount.

You can continue executing the Notebook cells to create some syntetic data. 

First some data for articles:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DIM_ARTICLE (
    ARTICLE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ARTICLE_NAME STRING,
    ARTICLE_CATEGORY STRING,
    ARTICLE_BRAND STRING,
    ARTICLE_COLOR STRING,
    ARTICLE_PRICE FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO DIM_ARTICLE (ARTICLE_ID, ARTICLE_NAME, ARTICLE_CATEGORY, ARTICLE_BRAND, ARTICLE_COLOR, ARTICLE_PRICE)
VALUES 
(1, 'Mondracer Infant Bike', 'Bike', 'Mondracer', 'Green', 3000),
(2, 'Premium Bicycle', 'Bike', 'Veloci', 'Red', 9000),
(3, 'Ski Boots TDBootz Special', 'Ski Boots', 'TDBootz', 'White', 600),
(4, 'The Ultimate Downhill Bike', 'Bike', 'Graviton', 'Red', 10000),
(5, 'The Xtreme Road Bike 105 SL', 'Bike', 'Xtreme', 'Grey', 8500),
(6, 'Carver Skis', 'Skis', 'Carver', 'White', 790),
(7, 'Outpiste Skis', 'Skis', 'Outpiste', 'Grey', 900),
(8, 'Racing Fast Skis', 'Skis', 'RacerX', 'Grey', 950);
```

Data for Customers:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DIM_CUSTOMER (
    CUSTOMER_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CUSTOMER_NAME STRING,
    CUSTOMER_REGION STRING,
    CUSTOMER_AGE INT,
    CUSTOMER_GENDER STRING,
    CUSTOMER_SEGMENT STRING
);

INSERT INTO DIM_CUSTOMER (CUSTOMER_ID, CUSTOMER_NAME, CUSTOMER_REGION, CUSTOMER_AGE, CUSTOMER_GENDER, CUSTOMER_SEGMENT)
SELECT 
    SEQ4() AS CUSTOMER_ID,
    'Customer ' || SEQ4() AS CUSTOMER_NAME,
    CASE MOD(SEQ4(), 5)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'North'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'South'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'East'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'West'
        ELSE 'Central'
    END AS CUSTOMER_REGION,
    UNIFORM(18, 65, RANDOM()) AS CUSTOMER_AGE,
    CASE MOD(SEQ4(), 2)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Male'
        ELSE 'Female'
    END AS CUSTOMER_GENDER,
    CASE MOD(SEQ4(), 3)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Regular'
        ELSE 'Occasional'
    END AS CUSTOMER_SEGMENT
FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 5000));
```

And Sales data:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FACT_SALES (
    SALE_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ARTICLE_ID INT,
    DATE_SALES DATE,
    CUSTOMER_ID INT,
    QUANTITY_SOLD INT,
    TOTAL_PRICE FLOAT,
    SALES_CHANNEL STRING,
    PROMOTION_APPLIED BOOLEAN,
    FOREIGN KEY (ARTICLE_ID) REFERENCES DIM_ARTICLE(ARTICLE_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES DIM_CUSTOMER(CUSTOMER_ID)
);

-- Populating Sales Fact Table with new attributes
INSERT INTO FACT_SALES (SALE_ID, ARTICLE_ID, DATE_SALES, CUSTOMER_ID, QUANTITY_SOLD, TOTAL_PRICE, SALES_CHANNEL, PROMOTION_APPLIED)
SELECT 
    SEQ4() AS SALE_ID,
    A.ARTICLE_ID,
    DATEADD(DAY, UNIFORM(-1095, 0, RANDOM()), CURRENT_DATE) AS DATE_SALES,
    UNIFORM(1, 5000, RANDOM()) AS CUSTOMER_ID,
    UNIFORM(1, 10, RANDOM()) AS QUANTITY_SOLD,
    UNIFORM(1, 10, RANDOM()) * A.ARTICLE_PRICE AS TOTAL_PRICE,
    CASE MOD(SEQ4(), 3)
        WHEN 0 THEN 'Online'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'In-Store'
        ELSE 'Partner'
    END AS SALES_CHANNEL,
    CASE MOD(SEQ4(), 4)
        WHEN 0 THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END AS PROMOTION_APPLIED
FROM DIM_ARTICLE A
JOIN TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 10000)) ON TRUE
ORDER BY DATE_SALES;
```

In the next section, you are going to explore the Semantic File. We have prepared two files that you can copy from the GIT repository:

```SQL
create or replace stage semantic_files ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE') DIRECTORY = ( ENABLE = true );

COPY FILES
    INTO @semantic_files/
    FROM @DASH_CORTEX_AGENTS_SUMMIT.PUBLIC.git_repo/branches/main/
    FILES = ('semantic.yaml', 'semantic_search.yaml');
```

## Step 4: Explore/Create the Semantic Model to be used by Cortex Analyst Tool

The [semantic model](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst/semantic-model-spec) map business terminology to the database schema and adds contextual meaning. It allows [Cortex Analyst](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst) generate the correct SQL for a question asked in natural language.

We have already provided a couple of semantic models for you to explore. 

### Open the existing semantic model

Under AI & ML -> Studio, select "Cortex Analyst"

![image](img/3_cortex_analyst.png)

Select the existing semantic.yaml file

![image](img/4_select_semantic_file.png)

### Test the Semantic Model

You can try some analytical questions to test your semantic file:

- What is the average revenue per transaction per sales channel?
- What products are often bought by the same customers?

### Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search Integration

We are going to explore the integration between Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search to provide better results. If we take a look at the semantic model, click on DIM_ARTICLE -> Dimensions and edit ARTICLE_NAME:

In the Dimension you will see that some Sample values have been provided:

![image](img/5_sample_values.png)

Let's see what happens if we ask the following question:

- What are the total sales for the carvers?

You may see this response:

![image](img/6_response.png)

Let's see what happens when we integrate the ARTICLE_NAME dimension with the Cortex Search Service we created in the Notebook (_ARTICLE_NAME_SEARCH). If you haven't run it already in the Notebook, this is the code to be executed:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE CORTEX SEARCH SERVICE _ARTICLE_NAME_SEARCH
  ON ARTICLE_NAME
  WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
  TARGET_LAG = '1 hour'
  EMBEDDING_MODEL = 'snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0'
AS (
  SELECT
      DISTINCT ARTICLE_NAME
  FROM DIM_ARTICLE
);
```

In the UI:

- Remove the sample values provided
- Click on + Search Service and add _ARTICLE_NAME_SEARCH

It will look like this:

![image](img/7_cortex_search_integration.png)

Click on save, also save your semantic file (top right) and ask the same question again:

- What are the total sales for the carvers?

Notice that now Cortex Analyst is able to provide the right answer because of the Cortex Search integration, we asked for "Carvers" but found that the correct article to ask about is "Carver Skis":

![image](img/8_right_answer.png)

Now that we have the tools ready, we can create our first App that leverages Cortex Agents API.

## Step 5: Setup Streamlit App that uses Cortex Agents API

Create one Streamlit App that uses the [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents) API.

We are going to leverate this initial code:

[streamlit_app.py](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-data-agents-using-snowflake-cortex/blob/main/streamlit_app.py)

Click on Projects -> Streamlit -> Streamlit App and "Create from repository":

![image](img/9_create_app.png)

![image](img/9_create_app_2.png)

Select the streamlit_app.py file:

![image](img/9_create_app_3.png)

![image](img/9_create_app_4.png)

And click on Create.

## Step 6: Explore the App

Open the Streamlit App and try some of these questions:

### Unstructured data questions

These are questions where the answers can be found in the PDF documents. For example:

- **What is the guarantee of the premium bike?**

![image](img/10_unstructured_question.png)

The streamlit_app.py code contains a display_citations() function as an example to show what pieces of information the Cortex Agent used to answer the questions. In this case we can see how it cites the warranty information extracted from the PDF file. 

Try other questions:

- **What is the length of the carver skis?**

![image](img/10_carvers_question.png)

Since we have processed images, the extracted descriptions can also be used by Cortex Agents to answer questions. Here's one example:

- **Is there any brand in the frame of the downhill bike?**

![image](img/10_bikes_question.png)

Fell free to explore the PDF documents and IMAGES files and ask your own questions

### Structured data questions

These are analytical questions where the answers can be found in Snowflake Tables. Some examples:

- **How much are we selling for the carvers per year for the North region?**

Notice that for this query, all 3 tables are used. Also Cortex Search integration in the semantic model understands that the article name is "Carver Skis":

![image](img/11_carver_query.png)

Some more questions to try:

- **How many infant bikes are we selling per month?**
- **What are the top 5 customers buying the carvers?**

Observe the behavior of the following question:

- **What are the monthly sales via online for the racing fast in central?**

Cortex Agents API sends the request to Cortex Analyst, but it is not able to filter by `customer_region`:

![image](img/14_central_question.png)

If we take a look at the [semantic file](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-data-agents-using-snowflake-cortex/blob/main/semantic_search.yaml) we can see that 'central' is not included as a sample value:

```code
      - name: CUSTOMER_REGION
        expr: CUSTOMER_REGION
        data_type: VARCHAR(16777216)
        sample_values:
          - North
          - South
          - East
        description: Geographic region where the customer is located.
```

This would be a good opportunity to fine tune the semantic model. Either adding all possible values if there aren't many or use Cortex Search as we have done before for the ARTICLE column.

## Step 7: Understand the Cortex Agents API

When calling the [Cortex Agents](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-agents) API, we define the tools the Agent can use in that call. You can read the simple [Streamlit App](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-build-data-agents-using-snowflake-cortex/blob/main/streamlit_app.py) you set up to understand the basics before trying to create something more elaborate.

We define the API_ENDPOINT for the Agent, and how to access the different tools we are going to use. In this lab we have two Cortex Search Services to retrieve information from PDFs about bikes and skis, and one Cortex Analyst Service to retrieve analytical information from Snowflake tables.

The Cortex Search Services point to the Services that we created in the Notebook. The Cortex Analyst uses the semantic model we verified earlier.

![image](img/12_api_1.png)

Those services are added to the payload we send to the Cortex Agents API. We define the model we want to use to build the final response, the tools to be used and any specific instructions for building the response:

![image](img/13_api_2.png)


## Step 8: Optional: Integrate Cortex Agents API with Slack

[This guide: Getting Started with Cortex Agents and Slack](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/integrate_snowflake_cortex_agents_with_slack/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0) provides instructions to integrate Cortex Agents with Slack. We are going to debrief it here step by step for the Tools you have created in this hands-on lab.
